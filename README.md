# GammaRay Android Platform Probe

This is a small Android application that does nothing but starting a GammaRay probe that
you can connect to with the GammaRay client over the network.

This is only useful for inspecting how a Qt application in general sees things on an Android
device, or what an Android device offers in general, not for debugging a specific Qt application
on Android. For that you need to compile the GammaRay probe into your application.

That is, you are most likely looking for https://github.com/KDAB/GammaRay rather than this.
